<p>The last few years have been talking about electronic passports, and now the prospect is becoming a reality. Recently it became known that new passports will be issued to residents of Moscow at the end of this year. We have collected all the information about the electronic passport in one text: what will be stored in it, how often it needs to be changed and whether hackers can hack it.</p>
<h2>What will an electronic passport look like?</h2>
<p>
   It will be a plastic card — almost like a bank card. On the front side there will be a full name, date of birth, photo of the owner and a chip that will store all the other information.
</p>
<h2>What will be in it?</h2>
<p>The registration address, SNILS, INN, biometric data (fingerprints of both hands and a face image), driver's documents, if any— will all be stored on the chip. It will turn out something like a single document. The same information will be in the mobile app. Only there it will be encrypted in the form of a QR code or NFC tag.</p>
